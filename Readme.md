# Blog Manager Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the Blog Manager Backend, a crucial component of our Blog Application. This backend system empowers users with essential features for user management and blog operations, allowing users to effortlessly create, update, and remove their blogs. While this project doesn't utilize a full-fledged database system, it offers a valuable learning experience for API development. Instead of traditional databases, it relies on CSV files for data storage.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure to run the `csvs.py` file. This step is crucial as it creates the necessary CSV files, which serve as the data storage for the application.
